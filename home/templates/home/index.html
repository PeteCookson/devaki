                <h2>Why Yoga?</h2>
                <p>Anyone can practise yoga. You don’t need special equipment or clothes – just a small space, a mat
                    and a strong desire for a healthier, more fulfilled way of life. Yoga postures, or asanas,
                    exercise every part of the body stretching and toning the muscles, joints, as well as the
                    skeletal system, working on the glands, nerves and internal organs, keeping all systems aligned
                    and in radiant health. The yogic breathing exercises, pranayama, revitalise the body and focus
                    the mind, leaving you calm and refreshed, whilst positive thinking and meditation give clarity
                    and concentration. </p>

                <h2>About Sivananda</h2>
                <p>Yoga is regarded as a divine science of life, revealed to enlightened sages in meditation. The
                    oldest evidence of yoga was found in a number of stone figures showing yogic postures, dating
                    back to 3,000 BC. One of the most important figures in the recent development of yoga has been
                    Swami Sivananda. Originally a medical doctor, he decided to follow the spiritual path, writing
                    over 300 books, pamphlets and leaflets, bringing his medical history to his yoga teachings.
                    Swami Sivananda founded Sivananda yoga which grew to what it is today, with many established
                    ashrams and Yoga Academies across the world.</p>

                    that is perfect for the mornings before work. The space she leads classes in is beautiful and
                    has plenty of natural light. Her voice, as she guides you through each move, leaves you feeling
                    calm and centered. Yoga with Lorna is magical!"</p>

                <p>"I've always wanted to try yoga, but the studios I went to were intimidating and overwhelming.
                    That's when my friend told me about Devaki Yoga and how it was smaller and more relaxing without
                    any of the hardcore stuff. I'm hooked!"</p>

                    quotes on the walls, and she always walks around to make sure you're doing the poses correctly.
